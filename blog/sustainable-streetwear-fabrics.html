    <p>Eco-conscious fashion is more than a trend — it's the new standard. Today’s streetwear brands are blending bold aesthetics with ethical responsibility. Here's a breakdown of 10 sustainable fabrics pushing the movement forward.</p>

    <h2>1. Organic Cotton</h2>
    <p>Grown without harmful chemicals, organic cotton reduces water usage and soil damage. It’s breathable, durable, and streetwear ready.</p>

    <h2>2. Hemp</h2>
    <p>Highly renewable and naturally pest-resistant, hemp is one of the most eco-friendly crops. It creates sturdy, long-lasting garments.</p>

    <h2>3. Tencel (Lyocell)</h2>
    <p>Made from wood pulp in a closed-loop process, Tencel is soft, breathable, and biodegradable — ideal for t-shirts and lining.</p>

    <h2>4. Recycled Polyester (rPET)</h2>
    <p>Created from recycled plastic bottles, rPET diverts waste from landfills and reduces carbon footprint while mimicking traditional poly aesthetics.</p>

    <h2>5. Bamboo</h2>
    <p>Fast-growing and naturally antibacterial, bamboo fabric is ultra-soft and requires minimal water or pesticides to grow.</p>

    <h2>6. Piñatex</h2>
    <p>A leather alternative made from pineapple leaves. Piñatex is cruelty-free and perfect for vegan-friendly accessories and trims.</p>

    <h2>7. Econyl</h2>
    <p>Regenerated nylon made from ocean and landfill waste. Used in activewear and fashion-forward street pieces alike.</p>

    <h2>8. Linen</h2>
    <p>Derived from flax plants, linen is biodegradable, lightweight, and has a naturally relaxed street aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>9. Cupro</h2>
    <p>A byproduct of cotton linter waste, cupro feels like silk but is plant-based. Common in high-end streetwear linings.</p>

    <h2>10. Deadstock Fabric</h2>
    <p>Repurposed leftover fabric from larger brands. Gives new life to existing materials and adds exclusive value to designs.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Brands like Soulmonk incorporate sustainable fabrics into every collection — not as an afterthought but as part of the design DNA. It shows that fashion and responsibility can coexist.</p>
