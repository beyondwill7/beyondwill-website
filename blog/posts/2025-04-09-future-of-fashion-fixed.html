  <h2>Why Streetwear, Why Now?</h2>
  <p>India's fashion market is exploding — and streetwear is leading the charge. With Gen Z prioritizing individuality, self-expression, and cultural authenticity, there's never been a better time to carve out your own niche.</p>

  <h2>1. Build Your Brand’s Identity</h2>
  <p>Your brand isn't just a logo. It's your voice, your vibe, your tribe. Focus on your story and what you stand for — sustainability, rebellion, inclusivity — whatever fuels your drop.</p>

  <h2>2. Design for Culture</h2>
  <p>Great streetwear is art you wear. Collaborate with local artists, incorporate Indian culture with modern aesthetics, and make each piece a conversation starter.</p>

  <h2>3. Launch That First Drop</h2>
